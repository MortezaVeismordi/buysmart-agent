# Trade-offs

## Monolith vs Microservices
We chose a modular monolith approach within the `backend/` directory to reduce operational overhead while maintaining domain boundaries.

## Django for Backend
**Pros**: Robust ORM, mature ecosystem, security features.
**Cons**: Heavier than FastAPI, but preferred for complex administrative tasks.
